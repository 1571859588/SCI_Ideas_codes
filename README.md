# Ideas Lab ðŸ§ª

This repository serves as a collection of implementation-ready machine learning concepts and techniques, designed with plug-and-play interfaces in mind. Each idea is implemented in its own directory with detailed documentation and examples.

## Purpose

- Provide clean, modular implementations of various machine learning concepts
- Make advanced techniques accessible through plug-and-play interfaces
- Serve as a learning resource with detailed documentation
- Track and showcase different machine learning ideas and their implementations
